# Artificial Neural Network ~ Deep learning Elective

1. In this project, the objective was to fabricate an ANN with rudimentary libraries like Numpy and Pandas only.
2. In addition, optimizers like ADAMS, RMS Prop, SGD Momentum were also incorporated to imporve accuracy. 
3. 'CCPP' is the name of the dataset. Three files have been uploaded, with 'CCPP_reguler' having no optimizers, and subsequently 'CCPP_SGD' & 'CCPP_ADAMS' having SGD with momentum and ADAMS incorporated respectively.
